 Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts
 The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing
 Failure is success if we learn from it
 Failure is so important. We speak about success all the time. It is the ability to resist failure or use failure that often leads to greater success. I’ve met people who don’t want to try for fear of failing.
 Every adversity, every failure, every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit
 I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed
 There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work and learning from failure
 I think you have to try and fail, because failure gets you closer to what you’re good at
 You don't get what you wish for.You get what you work for
 My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations
